The Person CRUD API is a RESTful service designed to manage person records efficiently using the Go programming language and the Gin web framework. It offers basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to help users organize and track person information. The API allows users to:

- Create a new person by providing an ID, name, age, and hobbies.
- Retrieve a list of all persons or a specific person by their ID.
- Update an existing person's details.
- Delete a person by their ID.

Each operation is accessible via specific endpoints and methods, making it easy to integrate with various applications.
